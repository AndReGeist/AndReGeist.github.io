      Our work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03476">"Learning deformable linear object dynamics from a single trajectory"</a>
      is available on arxiv. The paper proposes a physics-informed NeuralODE to learn accurate deformable object dynamics
      by learning local errors in force space via neural networks.
