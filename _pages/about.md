I’m a postdoc at the **University of Tübingen** and the **Max Planck Institute** for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen working with Georg Martius. 
My research focuses on **data-driven dynamics simulators for robotics**.

I’ve been a postdoc at the **RWTH Aachen** with Sebastian Trimpe working on physics-informed neuralODEs. 
During my PhD supervised by Sebastian Trimpe at the **Max Planck Institute** for Intelligent Systems Stuttgart, I developed probabilistic models to learn implicitly-constrained robot dynamics. 
I also developed the **“Wheelbot”** being a robot platform for teaching control theory and robotics.

During my Master's in **Theoretical Mechanical Engineering** at TU Hamburg, I worked on end-to-end vehicle control as a research intern at the Vehicle Dynamics and Control
laboratory of the **University of California, Berkeley** and as a research student on autonomous field exploration via AUV swarms at TU Hamburg.
